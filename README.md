# Pipelined-RISC-V-Processor
This repository contains our final project for the course "Computer Architecture" offered in Spring 2024.

"Task 1" contains a non-pipelined processor where bubble sort functions perfectly.
"Task 2" contains a pipelined processor with a forwarding unit; however, the bubble sort does not function due to the lack of a hazard detection unit.
"Task 3" contains a pipelined processor with a forwarding and hazard detection unit where bubble sort functions perfectly. This is the final version of the pipelined processor.

"Project Report" contains our final report for the project detailing our process.
"Bubble Sort Code" contains the assembly instructions we used to simulate bubble sort"
"Bubble Sort Instructions (for Verilog)" contains the instructions that were given to the Verilog processor to simulate the assembly instructions.
